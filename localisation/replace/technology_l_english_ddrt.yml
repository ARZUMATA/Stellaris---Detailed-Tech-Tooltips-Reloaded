 tech_wormhole_stabilization_desc:0 "A naturally occurring subspace wormhole is a fickle thing, and its fluctuating energy levels typically make it impossible to travel safely between its linked apertures. There are ways to temporarily stabilize its matrix, however. $dttr_tech_wormhole_stabilization_desc$"

 tech_jump_drive_1_desc:1 "A groundbreaking technological marvel, the Jump Drive shreds the local space-time continuum and rearranges it on the quantum level to be identical to that of the target destination - and thus the ship appears to near-instantly "jump" from system to system. $dttr_tech_jump_drive_1_desc$"
